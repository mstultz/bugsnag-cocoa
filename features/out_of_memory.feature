# Feature: Out of memory errors

# # Due to the combination of BrowserStack's behaviour when resetting the app and the way that our OOM detection works,
# # the I relaunch the app steps are currently sufficient to trigger the OOM mechanism. However, these tests may not
# # behave in the same way on local devices, device farms other that BrowserStack, or if we change that OOM detection works.

#   Background:
#     Given I clear all persistent data

#   Scenario: Out of memory errors are enabled when loading configuration
#     When I run "OOMLoadScenario"
#     And I wait to receive a request
#     Then the "Bugsnag-API-Key" header equals "0192837465afbecd0192837465afbecd"
#     And the event "unhandled" is false
#     And the exception "message" equals "OOMLoadScenario"
#     And the event has a "manual" breadcrumb named "OOMLoadScenarioBreadcrumb"
#     And I discard the oldest request

#     When I relaunch the app
#     And I configure Bugsnag for "OOMLoadScenario"
#     And I wait to receive a request
#     Then the "Bugsnag-API-Key" header equals "0192837465afbecd0192837465afbecd"
#     And the error is an OOM event

#     # Ensure the basic data from OOMs are present
#     And the event "device.jailbroken" is false
#     And the event "metaData.device.timezone" is not null
#     And the event "metaData.device.simulator" is false
#     And the event "metaData.device.wordSize" is not null
#     And the event "app.id" equals "com.bugsnag.iOSTestApp"
#     And the event "metaData.app.name" equals "iOSTestApp"
#     And the event "app.inForeground" is true
#     And the event "app.type" equals "iOS"
#     And the event "app.bundleVersion" is not null
#     And the event "app.version" is not null

#     # Ensure breadcrumbs are carried over
#     And the event has a "manual" breadcrumb named "OOMLoadScenarioBreadcrumb"
#     And the event has a "error" breadcrumb named "OOMLoadScenario"

#   Scenario: Out of memory errors are disabled by AutoDetectErrors
#     When I run "OOMAutoDetectErrorsScenario"
#     And I wait to receive a request
#     Then the request is valid for the error reporting API version "4.0" for the "iOS Bugsnag Notifier" notifier
#     And the event "unhandled" is false
#     And the exception "message" equals "OOMAutoDetectErrorsScenario"
#     And I discard the oldest request

#     And I relaunch the app
#     And I run "OOMAutoDetectErrorsScenario"
#     And I wait to receive a request
#     Then the request is valid for the error reporting API version "4.0" for the "iOS Bugsnag Notifier" notifier
#     And the event "unhandled" is false
#     And the exception "message" equals "OOMAutoDetectErrorsScenario"

#   Scenario: Out of memory errors are disabled by EnabledErrorTypes
#     When I run "OOMEnabledErrorTypesScenario"
#     And I wait to receive a request
#     Then the request is valid for the error reporting API version "4.0" for the "iOS Bugsnag Notifier" notifier
#     And the event "unhandled" is false
#     And the exception "message" equals "OOMEnabledErrorTypesScenario"
#     And I discard the oldest request

#     And I relaunch the app
#     And I run "OOMEnabledErrorTypesScenario"
#     And I wait to receive a request
#     Then the request is valid for the error reporting API version "4.0" for the "iOS Bugsnag Notifier" notifier
#     And the event "unhandled" is false
#     And the exception "message" equals "OOMEnabledErrorTypesScenario"
